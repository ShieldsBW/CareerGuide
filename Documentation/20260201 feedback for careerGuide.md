- We should keep the skill gap analysis saved instead of clearing it each time. And update it if we re-run the analysis as the user updates their skill statuses. 

- The skill gap analysis should be part of the directed flow of the app, once the user sets up their profile and initial roadmap, the skill gap analysis should be the first thing they are asked to complete. 

- The required goals of the role should automatically be added to the user's skill profile, and should be the first skills that the app prompts the user to enter skill levels for. After that then they can submit their pdf or manually add additional skills. 

- When the user clicks ‘back to skill gap analysis’ from the ‘your skills’ page, we are taken back to the milestones tab of the roadmap, but should land on the skill gap analysis tab. 

- When running the skill gap analysis, the app should do its best to consider skills that are similar, or point out skills that the user has added on their own that can possibly have transferable skillsets or even directly meet the requirements of the target job's skills.

- The ‘my skills’ and ‘edit goal’ buttons should be the same size on the top menu bar. 

- We should have a ‘daily goal’ suggestion on the main page that serves the purpose of helping drive the user towards meeting their goals as efficiently as possible. It would be nice to have a short goal (\~30 minutes), a medium goal (\~1h), and a longer goal (\~2h). The goals should never exceed 3 hours. 

- I think we should open up account registration to email as well, can you help me enable that authentication / registration method?
